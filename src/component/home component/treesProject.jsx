                        When you enroll through us, you become part of a new movement to help reduce the environmental impact of international student flights. Weâ€™ll donate to Plant-for-the-Planet, who plant trees on your behalf. These trees contribute towards absorbing the CO2 released into our atmosphere, which helps to protect our climate and the planet.
